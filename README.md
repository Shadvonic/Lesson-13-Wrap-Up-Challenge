# Lesson-13-Wrap-Up-Challenge

# SwiftUI Slots
This is a simple iOS app built with SwiftUI that simulates a slot machine game.

# Description
The app consists of a single view called ContentView. The view displays three slot machine reels, each showing a randomly selected fruit image. The player starts with 1000 credits, which is displayed at the top of the screen. To play the game, the player taps the "Spin" button.

If all three reels show the same fruit image, the player wins 15 credits. Otherwise, the player loses 5 credits. The player can keep playing until they run out of credits.

# Usage
To use this code, simply create a new SwiftUI project in Xcode and replace the contents of the ContentView.swift file with the code provided. Then, run the app in the iOS Simulator or on a physical device running iOS 14 or later.
